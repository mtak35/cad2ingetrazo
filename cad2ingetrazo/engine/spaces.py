"""ArchXQ ROOMS — found from the walls, named by the architect.

A room is a space ENCLOSED by walls: a hole in the union of a level's
joined wall plans (the walls engine closes every corner, T and crossing,
and doors don't cut the plans — so a room behind a door is still closed).
Nothing to draw: they are found again on every change of the walls.

What the architect gives them is kept in ``doc["rooms"]``: {"id",
"level", "x", "y" (a point inside), "name"}. A room found takes the name
of the record whose point lies in it; a record whose room is gone (the
walls moved over its point) is dropped when names are saved.
